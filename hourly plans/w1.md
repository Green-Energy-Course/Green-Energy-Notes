6. Types of energy (activity)
- What types of energy are there?
- What are the interconversions called, and how big are they?
- Which interconversions involve CO2 emissions? 
- Which can replace them?
7. Reminder of what to prepare:

1. Overview of energy conversion technologies (by definition of efficiency)
- Efficiency = energy out / energy in
- Generators: electricity out / kinetic in
- Power plants: electricity out / fuel in
- Cogeneration: (electricity out + useful heat out) / fuel in
- Gas turbines: kinetic out / fuel in
- Wind turbines: electricity out / wind in
- Heat pumps: coefficient of performance = heat out / electricity in
- Solar panels: electricity out / sunlight in
- Light bulbs: light out / electricity in
- Batteries: Round-trip efficiency = electricity out / electricity in
- electrolyzers: fuel out / electricity in
- crops: fuel out / sunlight in
- (bio)refinery: fuel out / fuel in
- chemical plants: chemical energy out / chemical energy in
- Boilers: heat out / fuel in
- Electric boilers: heat out / electricity in
