# Green Energy Notes

This repository contains notes for the GreenEnergy course.

To be fully in the loop, you need to come to class and follow the material on Absalon! This repository complements Absalon, but does not make it redundant. Absalon will link to this repository when needed.

## Plan
For an overview of the course contents see the [plan](plan/index.md).
You'll find there links to material including Scott's lecture slides.
Note: Days are written in yyMdd, where the month M is indicated by a letter - B for February and C for March.

## Lecture Notes
Core content from lectures will be written up in markdown here under the appropriate week. Allow some time after the actual lecture for these to get typed up. They will be linked to under the [plan](plan/index.md).

## Exercises
Calculation exercises are also part of the curriculum, and are available as jupyter notebooks in the sister repository
