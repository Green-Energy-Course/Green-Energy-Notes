# Green Energy Notes

This repository contains notes for the GreenEnergy course.

To be fully in the loop, you need to come to class and follow the material on Absalon! This repository complements Absalon, but does not make it redundant. Absalon will link to this repository when needed.

## Plan
For an overview of the course contents see [hourly plans](hourly%20plans/index.md).
You'll find there links to material including Scott's lecture slides.
Note: Days are written in yyMdd, where the month M is indicated by a letter - B for February and C for March, and refer to the 2025 Premier of the course.

## Lecture Notes
Blackboard lectures will be written up in markdown under the appropriate week. Allow some time after the actual lecture for these to get typed up. They will be linked to under Plan

## Exercises
Calculation exercises are also part of the curriculum, and are available as jupyter notebooks in the sister repository
