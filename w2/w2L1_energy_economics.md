Cost of electricity
===================

This lecture covered the *cost* of electricity. The *price* was discussed on the following course day.

Emissions cost
--------------

The _emissions intensity of electricity_, EIE, can be defined as follows:

$\mathrm{EIE} = \frac{\text{lifetime emissions}}{\text{lifetime electricity generated}}$

$\mathrm{EIE}$ typical units: \[kg CO2\] / \[MWh\]

We ca break the lifetime emissions into an _emissions intensity of capital_, EIC, which is the CO2 emissions associated with installing a unit of nameplate power capacity, and the _emissions intensity of operation_, EIO, which is the emissions per unit of nameplate power capacity per unit of time. The lifetime emissions of electricity is, for fossil fuel power plants, dominated by the fuel consumption, part of EIO. For renewable electricity sources it is typically much lower and dominated by the embodied emissions in the materials, part of EIC.

- $\mathrm{EIC}$ typical units: \[ton CO2\ / MW\]
- $\mathrm{EIO}$ typical units: \[ton CO2\ / MW / year \] 

As an equation, the emissions intensity of electricity becomes

$\mathrm{EIE} = \frac{\mathrm{EIC}\cdot P + \mathrm{EIO}\cdot P \cdot L}{P\cdot C\cdot L} $

where $P$ is the installed nameplate power, $L$ is the lifetime of the project, and $C$ is the capacity factor

- $P$ typical units: \[MW\]
- $L$ typical units: \[year\]
- $C$ typical units: \[%\]

The emissions intensity of capital can be further broken up into embodied emissions in the materials used, EIC$_{\text{mat}}$, the emissions associated with processing the materials, EIC$_{\text{proc}}$, and the emissions associated with installation, EIC$_{\text{inst}}$.

$\mathrm{EIC}= \mathrm{EIC}_{\text{mat}} + \mathrm{EIC}_{\text{proc}} + \mathrm{EIC}_{\text{inst}}$

The emboidied emissions associated with the materials can be described as the sum over materials of the _mass intensity_ of that material per power for that technology, MI, times the material's emissions _characterization factor_, CF.

- $\mathrm{MI}$, typical units \[t/MW\]
- $\mathrm{CF}$, typical units \[t CO2 / t\]

As an equation, this is written:
$\mathrm{EIC}_{\text{mat}} = \sum_i^{\text{materials}} \mathrm{MI}_i \cdot \mathrm{CF}_i$

Emissions cost example: wind vs solar
-------------------------------------

What is **embodied carbon per MW of installed capacity** ($\mathrm{EIC}_{\text{mat}}$) for **(a) wind** and **(b) solar**? 

Use the following materials requirements (MI) for wind and solar:

| material | MI for wind / \[t/MW\] | MI for solar / [\t/MW\] |
---------------------------------------------------------------
|concrete  | 500                    | 500                     |
|steel     | 50                     | 100                     |
|aluminium | 0                      | 60                      |
|copper    | 5                      | 4                       |
|silicon   | 0                      | 5                       |

And the following characterization factors:

| material | CF / \[t CO2 / t\] | 
---------------------------------
|concrete  | 0.18               |
|steel     | 1.9                |
|aluminium | 8.5                |
|copper    | 4.6                |
|silicon   | 10                 |

What is the **emissions intensity of electricity** for **(c) wind** and **(d) solar** assuming that the above-calculated $\mathrm{EIC}_{\text{mat}}$ is the dominant cause of emissions over the project lifetime (approximate $\mathrm{EIC}_{\text{proc}}$, $\mathrm{EIC}_{\text{proc}}$, and $\mathrm{EIO}$ to all be zero). Use the following lifetimes and capacity factors:

|                | wind | solar |
---------------------------------
|$L$ / \[years]  | 25   | 50%   |
|$C$             | 30   | 10%   |

Emissions payback time
----------------------

The emissions payback time, $\mathrm{EPT}$, is the amount of time, in years, for a project to come out emissions neutral compared to a situation in which the project was not built.

- $\mathrm{EPT}$, typical units \[year\]

This is equal to the emissions due to installation divided by the _emissions saving rate_ saved per installed capacity per year of operation, ESR:

$ \mathrm{EPT} = \frac{\mathrm{EIC}{ESR}} $

Here, the emissions saving rate is the _marginal emissions of electricity_ generated minus the marginal emissions of electricity for the electricity that it replaces in the grid. For renewables, since we are assuming for now that the entire lifetime emissions is due to the materials cost (EIO=0), we can also approximate the marginal emissions due to a unit of electricity generated as zero. The emissions saving rate for renewables is therefore the average electricity generation rate per unit installed power times the emissions intensity of electricity in the present mix in the grid:

$\mathrm{ESR}(\text{renewables}) = C \cdot \mathrm{EIE}_{\text{grid}}$

where we have used that capacity factor $C$ can be defined as the average electricity generation rate per unit of installed power.



Emissions payback time example: wind and solar
----------------------------------------------

Using the results of the previous example and an average grid emissions intensity $\mathrm{EIE}_{\text{grid}}$ for Denmark in 2024 of 120 [g/kWh], **what is the emissions payback** time for **(a) solar** and **(b) wind**?


Financial cost
--------------
The main financial way to describe the cost of electricity is as the **levelized cost of electricity** (LCOE)

- LCOE, typical unit: \[EUR / MWh\]

The levelized cost is defined as the sum of costs of a project divided by the total electricity generated by the project over its lifetime, with a catch: _money now is worth more than money later_. In otherwords, both the future costs and the future electricity are "discounted" by a certain amount each year. This amount, usually expressed in percent, is the _discount rate_, r. The costs can be divided into capital expenditure ($\mathrm{CAPEX}$) and operation expenditure $\mathrm{OPEC}$. All of these are summed over the years $y$ of a project starting in year 1 and up until its lifetime $L$.

- $\mathrm{LCOE}_y$, typical unit \[EUR/MWh\]
- $\mathrm{CAPEX}_y$, typical unit \[EUR\]
- $\mathrm{OPEX}_y$, typical unit \[EUR\]
- $E_y$, typical unit \[MWh\]
- $r$, typical unit \[%\]

As an equation, the LCOE is written:

$\mathrm{LCOE} = \frac{\sum_y^L \frac{\mathrm{CAPEX}_y + \mathrm{OPEX}_y}{(1+r)^y}}{\sum_y \frac{E_y}{(1+r)^y}}$

Typically, LCOE is calculated in a spreadsheet with each column representing a year. For a project that is built entirely in one year and starts generating electricity the following year, $\mathrm{CAPEX}_0>0$ and $\mathrm{CAPEX}_y=0$ for $y>0$, while $\mathrm{E}_0=0$ and $\mathrm{E}_y=C \cdot P$ for $y>0$
