4. The exponential function, Terawatts, and Gigatons of CO2
   - [slides here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/0zlt6mhsn7uxddq9h6lpt/26B02_01_Energy_and_Emissions.pptx?rlkey=ccmwnoz1ewkloqezz27bht59w&dl=0)
   - Cycles vs exponential growth
   - units of energy: J -> TJ, Wh -> GWh
   - units of emissions: kgCO2 -> GtCO2, kgCO2eq -> GtCO2eq
   - CO2 intensity of electricity: electricitymaps.com

1. Evt. questions about the Progress and the Hype

2. Overview of energy conversion technologies (by definition of efficiency)
   - [slides here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/wvsiseklqvuy63041flon/26B03_02_Energy_technology_overview.pptx?rlkey=dudgu9l6kwahbg2iq8fygx0lz&dl=0)
   - Efficiency = energy out / energy in
   - Hydropower: electricity out / gravitational energy in
   - Chemical power plants: electricity out / fuel in
   - Nuclear power plants: electricity out / fuel in
   - Cogeneration: (electricity out + useful heat out) / fuel in
   - Wind turbines: electricity out / wind in
   - Solar panels: electricity out / sunlight in
   - Batteries: Round-trip efficiency = electricity out / electricity in
   - Pumped hydro: Round-trip efficiency = electricity out / electricity in
   - electrolyzers: fuel out / electricity in
   - Heat pumps: coefficient of performance = heat out / electricity in
   - Combustion engine cars: efficiency = kinetic out / electricity in
   - Electric cars: efficiency = kinetic out / electricity in
