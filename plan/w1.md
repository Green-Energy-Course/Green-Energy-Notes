3. Climate and energy in GWh and GtCO2
   - [slides here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/vubuqsmggqet3q9s7t3p1/25B03_01_Energy_and_Emissions.pptx?rlkey=m0xpd97z4sw3374v4o5ggucdf&dl=0)
   - Cycles vs exponential growth
   - units of energy: J -> TJ, Wh -> GWh
   - units of emissions: kgCO2 -> GtCO2, kgCO2eq -> GtCO2eq
   - CO2 intensity of electricity: electricitymaps.com

1. Overview of energy conversion technologies (by definition of efficiency)
   - [slides here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mnj8h0swxteknhlbmmxqk/25B04_02_Energy_technology_overview-v3.pptx?rlkey=ek3462y31ciify035qbxtgq30&dl=0)
   - Efficiency = energy out / energy in
   - Hydropower: electricity out / gravitational energy in
   - Chemical power plants: electricity out / fuel in
   - Nuclear power plants: electricity out / fuel in
   - Cogeneration: (electricity out + useful heat out) / fuel in
   - Wind turbines: electricity out / wind in
   - Solar panels: electricity out / sunlight in
   - Batteries: Round-trip efficiency = electricity out / electricity in
   - Pumped hydro: Round-trip efficiency = electricity out / electricity in
   - electrolyzers: fuel out / electricity in
   - Heat pumps: coefficient of performance = heat out / electricity in
   - Combustion engine cars: efficiency = kinetic out / electricity in
   - Electric cars: efficiency = kinetic out / electricity in
