1. The economics of PtX
   - Levelized cost of green hydrogen
   - Levelized cost of green ammonia, steel, methanol, kerosene

2. Hydrogen as an energy carrier? 
   - Case: how to turn Spanish sun into German hydrogen?
   - Case: battery EV or fuel cell EV or green gasoline? 
   - Case: how to turn summer sun into winter heat?

3. PtX's CO2 demand

4. Bypassing hydrogen: direct electrolysis
   - CO2 reduction
   - N2 reduction
5. Ethylene as the gateway molecule?
